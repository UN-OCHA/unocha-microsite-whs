        <p>Due to conflicts and disasters around the world, millions of people need humanitarian assistance in order to survive. As the scale of human suffering is now greater than at any time since the Second World War, former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon convened the World Humanitarian Summit for the first time in the 70-year history of the United Nations. The aim was to generate commitments to reduce suffering and deliver better for people around the globe.</p>
        <p>The Summit took place in Istanbul on 23 and 24 May 2016, bringing together 9,000 participants from 180 Member States, including 55 Heads of State and Government, hundreds of private sector representatives, and thousands of people from civil society and non-governmental organizations.</p>

        <h2>On A4H and PACT</h2>
        <p>The Agenda for Humanity and its five Core Responsibilities are part of the report “One Humanity, Shared Responsibility”, which guided the overarching framework of the World Humanitarian Summit. Participants at the Summit demonstrated overwhelming support for the Agenda for Humanity and announced thousands of commitments to turn it into reality. More than a dozen initiatives, partnerships, platforms and alliances were either newly developed or strengthened through the World Humanitarian Summit process and will help implement the Agenda for Humanity.</p>
        <p>The Platform for Action, Commitments and Transformations (PACT) is a dynamic advocacy tool for all stakeholders involved in meeting humanitarian needs and reducing risk and vulnerability in their efforts to advance the Agenda for Humanity.</p>
        <p>The PACT currently reflects all the commitments that were received in writing before or during the World Humanitarian Summit. Further commitments will be added to the platform to sustain the spirit of dynamic collaboration and ensure continued progress in advancing the Agenda for Humanity.</p>

        <h2>WHS Consultation Process</h2>
        <p>Between June 2014 and July 2015, an extensive and inclusive worldwide consultation process took place.  More than 23,000 people in 153 countries were consulted, including humanitarian stakeholders and affected people and communities.</p>
        <p>In February 2016, former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon published his report 
        “One Humanity, Shared Responsibility”. In the report, he called on Member States, the United Nations, humanitarian organizations and other relevant stakeholders to place humanity—people’s safety, dignity and their right to thrive—at the centre of global decision-making.</p>
        <p>The Agenda for Humanity is a five-point plan that outlines the changes needed to alleviate suffering, reduce risk and lessen vulnerability on a global scale. It served as the overarching framework of the first-ever World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul, held from 23 to 24 May 2016, asking global leaders to act on five Core Responsibilities.</p>

              <p>In his report to the seventy-first General Assembly on the outcomes of the World Humanitarian Summit, former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for all stakeholders to deliver on their commitments and continue to advance the Agenda for Humanity through four key steps:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>To sustain the spirit of collaboration, the online Platform for Action, Commitments and Transformation (PACT) was launched. The platform is a dynamic space to report on progress and showcase results, build engagement and create new partnerships.</li>
              <li>An annual synthesis report will be produced to assess collective progress and identify areas that may be lagging.</li>
              <li>A high-level stocktaking meeting within the next five years should assess progress against the goal of reducing humanitarian needs, risk and vulnerability, and identify gaps and new challenges.</li>
              <li>All stakeholders are encouraged to use relevant international, regional, national and cross-cutting forums to hold dialogue in support of taking forward the Agenda for Humanity, turning the commitments into reality and making additional commitments.</li>
